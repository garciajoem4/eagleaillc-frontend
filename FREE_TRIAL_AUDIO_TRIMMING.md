# Free Trial Audio Trimming Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of audio trimming functionality for free trial users in the Eagle AI LLC frontend application. The system automatically trims audio recordings longer than 5 minutes for free trial users while preserving the full recordings for future access when users upgrade to paid plans.

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Storage Strategy
- **Free trial users**: Store both trimmed (5-minute) and full versions
- **Paid users**: Store only the full version
- **Seamless upgrade**: Automatic access to full recordings when upgrading from free trial

### 2. Audio Trimming Capability
- Uses Web Audio API for precise audio trimming
- Maintains original audio quality and format
- Preserves metadata during trimming process
- Fallback handling for unsupported browsers

### 3. Smart Audio Loading
- Automatically serves appropriate version based on user subscription status
- Free trial users get trimmed versions
- Paid users get full versions (with fallback to trimmed if full not available)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Audio Trimmer Utility (`src/utils/audioTrimmer.ts`)
```typescript
class AudioTrimmer {
  static async getAudioDuration(file: File | Blob): Promise<number>
  static async trimAudio(file: File | Blob, maxDurationSeconds: number): Promise<TrimResult>
  private static audioBufferToBlob(audioBuffer: AudioBuffer): Promise<Blob>
}
```

**Features:**
- Audio duration detection using Web Audio API
- Precise audio trimming to specified duration
- Blob conversion utilities
- Error handling for unsupported formats

#### 2. Enhanced Audio Storage Service (`src/services/audioStorageService.ts`)
```typescript
interface StoredAudio {
  id: string;
  fileName: string;
  blob: File | Blob;
  mimeType: string;
  size: number;
  uploadDate: Date;
  lastAccessed: Date;
  metadata?: {
    isTrimmed?: boolean;
    hasFullVersion?: boolean;
    isFullVersion?: boolean;
    duration?: number;
    transcriptId?: string;
    processed?: boolean;
  };
}
```

**New Methods:**
- `storeDualAudio()`: Store both trimmed and full versions
- `getAudioForUser()`: Get appropriate version based on subscription status
- `hasDualVersions()`: Check for both versions
- `migrateFreeTrialToFull()`: Upgrade free trial recordings

#### 3. Enhanced Process File Button (`src/components/ui/process-file-button.tsx`)
**Free Trial Detection:**
- Uses Clerk authentication to detect free trial users
- Checks for specific organization ID and role

**Audio Processing Flow:**
1. Detect user subscription status
2. Check audio duration
3. Trim audio if needed (free trial + > 5 minutes)
4. Store appropriate version(s) in IndexedDB
5. Continue with normal processing workflow

#### 4. Updated Recording Detail Hook (`src/hooks/useRecordingDetail.ts`)
**Smart Audio Loading:**
- Uses `getAudioForUser()` method
- Automatically serves correct version based on user status
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

## User Experience

### Free Trial Users
1. **Upload audio > 5 minutes**:
   - System automatically trims to 5 minutes
   - User sees trimmed version immediately
   - Full version stored for future access

2. **Upload audio ≤ 5 minutes**:
   - No trimming needed
   - Normal processing continues

3. **Upgrade to paid plan**:
   - Automatic access to full versions
   - No re-upload required

### Paid Users
1. **Upload any duration**:
   - No trimming applied
   - Full audio stored and accessible

## Configuration

### Constants
```typescript
const FREE_TRIAL_ORG_ID = 'org_33nodgVx3c02DhIoiT1Wen7Xgup';
const FREE_TRIAL_ROLE = 'org:free_trial';
const FREE_TRIAL_TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS = 300; // 5 minutes
```

### Storage Structure
- **Trimmed version**: `recording-{id}`
- **Full version**: `recording-{id}-full`
- **Metadata**: Includes trimming status and version information

## Error Handling

### Audio Trimming Failures
- Graceful fallback to original file
- Console logging for debugging
- User experience remains uninterrupted

### Storage Failures
- Continues processing even if localStorage fails
- Fallback audio options available
- Error logging for monitoring

### Browser Compatibility
- Web Audio API feature detection
- Fallback strategies for unsupported browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Free trial users**: Get immediate functionality with upgrade path
- **Paid users**: Full feature access without limitations
- **Seamless upgrade**: No data loss or re-upload required

### For Business
- **Storage optimization**: Reduced storage usage for free trials
- **User retention**: Preserved full recordings encourage upgrades
- **Cost control**: Managed resource usage for free tier

### For Development
- **Maintainable code**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to extend or modify
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful degradation

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Free trial user uploads > 5 min audio**:
   - Verify trimming occurs
   - Check dual storage
   - Confirm immediate playback of trimmed version

2. **Free trial user uploads ≤ 5 min audio**:
   - Verify no trimming
   - Confirm normal storage

3. **Paid user uploads any duration**:
   - Verify no trimming
   - Confirm full audio storage

4. **User upgrade scenario**:
   - Start as free trial with recordings
   - Upgrade to paid plan
   - Verify access to full versions

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for AudioTrimmer utility
- Integration tests for storage service
- E2E tests for complete upload flow

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Progress indicators** for trimming process
2. **Batch migration** tools for large datasets
3. **Admin dashboard** for monitoring storage usage
4. **Advanced analytics** on trimming patterns

### Monitoring
- Track trimming frequency
- Monitor storage usage patterns
- Alert on unusual processing failures

## Conclusion

The free trial audio trimming implementation provides a sophisticated solution that balances user experience, business needs, and technical requirements. The dual storage strategy ensures that free trial users can immediately use the application while preserving their full data for future access, creating a smooth upgrade path that benefits both users and the business.
